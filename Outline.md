It would be useful if when we revamp the docs we could have interactive guides for every use case. So I'm going to try and list different combinations of them here:

 - Todo list
 - - User Todo list
 - - - Private Todo list
 - - Shared Todo list
 - - - Shared Private Todo list
 - Contact profile
 - - Search contacts
 - - Share private contact details
 - - - Search private data
 - Collaborative Documents
 - - (Want search or privacy? Apply above techniques!)
 - Video upload
 - - Live video stream
 - - (Want user videos, lists or an index? Apply above techniques!)
 - Infinity scroll
 - CMS (Content management system)
